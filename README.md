Starknet Tarot is a web application that allows users to draw a card from the Major Arcana deck based on the latest block number of the Starknet mainnet. The application is designed to be a tool for guidance and self-reflection, inspired by the ancient practice of tarot reading.

Draws a card from the Major Arcana deck based on the spirit number
Displays the drawn card along with its meaning
Provides an explanation of how the spirit number is derived from the Starknet mainnet block ID
Safe and reliable, does not require users to provide wallet addresses or pay gas fees
How It Works
Starknet Tarot is built on top of the Starknet blockchain, a secure and privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy-preserving smart contracts. The application fetches the latest block number of the Starknet mainnet using Infura API, and uses this number as the spirit number to draw a card from the Major Arcana deck.

The application is deployed on the Glitch platform, a cloud-based development environment that provides backend API services for the application to communicate with the Starknet mainnet. The Glitch platform allows users to remix and modify the source code of the application, making it easy for developers to experiment with and contribute to the project.
