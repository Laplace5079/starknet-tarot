Starknet Tarot

Draw your Starknet Tarot Card here: https://starknet-tarot.glitch.me/

Starknet Tarot is a web application that allows users to draw a card from the Major Arcana deck based on the energy number from a smartcontrct deployed on Starknet testnet. The application is designed to be a tool for guidance and self-reflection, inspired by the ancient practice of tarot reading.

Features:
Fetches the latest energy number of contruct on the Starknet testnet to use as a spirit number
Contract 0x0093c0834371ffa3af62286e3ed6d506285b215bcc66a92cd3201186dccc0ba0 is deployed with Cairo 1.0 and will move to mainnet when mainnet is ready for 1.0.
Draws a card from the Major Arcana deck,upright or reversed, based on the spirit number
Displays the drawn card,upright or reversed, along with its meaning
Provides a button for user to supply energy by interacting with contract
Safe and reliable, does not require users to provide wallet addresses nor pay gas fees

How It Works:
Starknet Tarot is built on top of the Starknet blockchain, a secure and privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy-preserving smart contracts. The application fetches the data from ZK Starknet using Infura API, and uses this number as the spirit number to draw a card from the Major Arcana deck.

The application is deployed on the Glitch platform, a cloud-based development environment that provides backend API services for the application to communicate with the Starknet. The Glitch platform allows users to remix and modify the source code of the application, making it easy for developers to experiment with and contribute to the project.
